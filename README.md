# Project Description
This document explores the implementation of position control in BLDC motors using an ESC. It will examine all components of the project, including motor control theory, software design, electronics hardware design of the ESC and mechanical design of BLDC motors at a technical level. It shows that it is possible to implement position control on BLDC motors, however much work is needed to improve the performance of the control strategy.

Code is not avaliable due to NDA.
